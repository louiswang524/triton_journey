# GPU Architecture and Parallel Computing

Understanding GPU architecture is fundamental to writing efficient GPU programs. This section covers the key components of GPU architecture and how they differ from traditional CPU architecture.

## Introduction

GPUs are designed for massive parallel processing, containing thousands of smaller cores compared to CPUs which have fewer but more powerful cores. This architectural difference makes GPUs particularly suitable for tasks that can be parallelized.
