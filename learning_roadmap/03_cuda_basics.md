# CUDA Programming Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts of CUDA programming, from setting up the development environment to writing your first CUDA programs.

## Introduction

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model. It allows developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose processing through a C/C++ extension.
